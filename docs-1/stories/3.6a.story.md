# Story 3.6a: Echo Service Example Using aegis-sdk-dev Bootstrap

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer new to AegisSDK,
**I want** a complete echo service example created using aegis-sdk-dev bootstrap tools,
**so that** I can understand best practices for starting new services and identify any gaps in the dev tooling before creating more complex examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create echo-service-ddd example using `aegis bootstrap -p echo-service-ddd` command
2. Example must demonstrate proper use of aegis-sdk-dev tooling throughout development lifecycle:
   - Project bootstrap with Enterprise DDD template
   - Environment validation using `aegis-validate`
   - Test execution using `aegis-test`
3. Implement same business functionality as apps/echo-service but following aegis-sdk-dev patterns:
   - Multiple echo modes (simple, reverse, uppercase, delayed, transform, batch)
   - RPC handlers for echo, batch_echo, metrics, health, ping
   - Service registration with monitor-api
   - Metrics collection and health monitoring
4. Must follow strict DDD principles with hexagonal architecture:
   - Clear domain layer with entities, value objects, and domain services
   - Application layer with use cases and command/query handlers
   - Infrastructure layer with ports and adapters pattern
   - Anti-corruption layer for external service integration
5. Include comprehensive tests following TDD principles (minimum 80% coverage)
6. Document any gaps, limitations, or improvement opportunities in aegis-sdk-dev
7. Example must be deployable to both local and K8s environments
8. Create clear README with setup instructions and architectural explanation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 3.4 (SDK Developer Experience):
- Created aegis-sdk-dev package with bootstrap, validate, and test commands
- Bootstrap creates Enterprise DDD structure with all layers
- Validation checks NATS, K8s, Docker environments
- This story validates the dev tools work well for real service development

From Story 3.6 (SDK Pattern Validation):
- Planning comprehensive trading-simulator example for K8s
- Echo service will be simpler precursor to validate dev workflow
- Focus on developer experience and tool effectiveness

### Architecture Requirements
**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Python 3.13+ for backend development
- FastAPI for service APIs (if needed)
- NATS & JetStream 2.9+ for messaging
- NATS KV Store for service registry
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Helm Charts for K8s deployment

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

```

**DDD Principles to Follow** [Source: architecture/ddd_prompt.md]:
- Domain layer: Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services, Repository interfaces
- Application layer: Use Cases, Command/Query Handlers, Application Services
- Infrastructure layer: Adapters for external services, Repository implementations
- Anti-corruption layer: Translators for external service integration
- Aggregate roots with consistency boundaries
- Domain events for significant business occurrences
- Ubiquitous language throughout the codebase

**aegis-sdk-dev Features to Use**:
- `aegis bootstrap`: Create project with Enterprise DDD template
- `aegis-validate`: Check environment configuration and dependencies
- `aegis-test`: Run test suite with coverage reporting
- `aegis-quickstart`: Optional interactive setup wizard

**Existing Echo Service Capabilities** [Reference: apps/echo-service]:
- Echo modes: simple, reverse, uppercase, delayed, transform, batch
- RPC endpoints: echo, batch_echo, metrics, health, ping
- Service registration with monitor-api via HTTP POST
- Metrics tracking: request counts, latency, mode distribution
- Health checks with component status
- Instance ID tracking for load balancing visibility

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Mandatory**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Red-Green-Refactor
- **Framework**: Pytest only (no unittest, nose, etc.)
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% overall, 100% for critical paths
- **Integration**: Use testcontainers for NATS testing
- **Naming**: test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures, not setUp/tearDown
- **Assertions**: Use plain assert statements
- **Parametrization**: Use @pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple cases
- **Async**: Use @pytest.mark.asyncio for async tests

### Key Implementation Notes
1. This is a learning/validation exercise for aegis-sdk-dev tools
2. Must identify and document any gaps in the dev tooling
3. Should serve as a template for future service development
4. Focus on developer experience and ease of use
5. Validate that bootstrap template provides good starting point

### Success Criteria
- Service runs successfully both locally and in K8s
- All aegis-sdk-dev commands work as expected
- Clear documentation of any tool limitations
- Service demonstrates all SDK patterns correctly
- Can be used as reference for future developers

### Completion Notes

#### Validation Task (2025-08-11) - Template K8s Deployment Verification
- [x] Successfully generated new project using `aegis bootstrap` command
- [x] Project structure follows Enterprise DDD template with all expected layers
- [x] Make commands work seamlessly for K8s deployment:
  - `make deploy-to-kind`: One-command build and deploy
  - `make docker-build`: Builds Docker image with versioning
  - `make kind-load`: Loads image to Kind cluster
  - `make helm-install`: Deploys using Helm charts
- [x] Service successfully runs in K8s (pod status: Running)
- [x] Service appears in monitor-ui frontend dashboard
- [x] Service connects to NATS and registers in KV store
- [x] Health and ping RPC endpoints are defined in generated code

**Make Command Sequence for K8s Deployment:**
```bash
# Complete one-command deployment
make deploy-to-kind

# Or step-by-step:
make test-local      # Pre-validate code
make docker-build    # Build Docker image
make kind-load       # Load to Kind cluster
make helm-install    # Deploy with Helm
```

**Key Finding:** The aegis-sdk-dev bootstrap template successfully generates a K8s-ready service that:
- Can be deployed with a single Make command
- Automatically handles heartbeat via SDK
- Registers with service discovery
- Appears in the monitoring frontend
