# Story 1.2: Key Communication Patterns Performance Benchmarking

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** to establish and document the baseline performance for the core RPC and Event communication patterns
**so that** we can objectively measure the performance impact of new features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A repeatable performance test script is created.
2. The p99 latency and max throughput (requests/sec) for the RPC pattern are measured and recorded.
3. The publish latency and max throughput (events/sec) for the JetStream Event pattern are measured and recorded.

## Dev Notes

### Story Context
This story is about **validating and documenting** existing performance benchmarks that were implemented during Story 1.1. The performance testing infrastructure is already in place:
- ✅ `test_performance_benchmarks.py` - Local Docker-based benchmarks
- ✅ `test_performance_k8s.py` - Kubernetes NATS benchmarks
- ✅ `run_performance_benchmarks.py` - Automated benchmark runner
- ✅ K8s NATS cluster deployed and running
- ✅ Port-forwarding configured and active

**Developer Action**: Execute validation tasks to confirm all acceptance criteria are met and document the baseline performance metrics.

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Performance benchmarks were conducted during SDK validation
- Initial results showed RPC latency of 3.330ms (p99) with port-forwarded K8s connection
- Event throughput achieved 5,403 events/s (exceeds minimum viable threshold)
- Memory usage was minimal per service instance
- Test infrastructure already exists in `packages/aegis-sdk/tests/integration/`
- Port-forwarding script available: `packages/aegis-sdk/setup-nats-port-forward.sh`

### Epic 0 K8s Infrastructure Context
Based on Epic 0 implementation [Source: Story 0.2]:
- **NATS Cluster Configuration**:
  - 3-node HA cluster deployed via Helm charts
  - JetStream enabled with 10Gi FileStore PVC
  - Service name: `{{ .Release.Name }}-nats` on port 4222
  - GOMEMLIMIT set to 7GiB for 8Gi pods
  - Pod topology spread constraints for distribution
- **Access Method**:
  - Use kubectl port-forward for local testing: `kubectl port-forward svc/aegis-trader-nats 4222:4222`
  - ClusterIP service requires port-forwarding for external access
- **Namespace**: Deployments use configurable namespace (e.g., `aegis-test`)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: `packages/aegis-sdk/README.md`]:
- **RPC Pattern**:
  - Target latency: <1ms (p99) for local calls
  - Queue group load balancing support
  - Timeout handling (default 5s)
- **Event Pattern**:
  - Target throughput: 50,000+ events/s
  - JetStream for reliability
  - At-least-once delivery guarantee

### Technical Stack
[Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]:
- Python 3.13+ required
- NATS & JetStream 2.9+ as core messaging platform
- Testing framework: Pytest >=7.0.0
- All tests must use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async operations
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple test cases

### Project Structure
[Source: `architecture/source-tree.md`]:
```
/packages/aegis-sdk/
├── tests/
│   ├── integration/        # Existing integration tests
│   └── performance/        # New performance benchmarks (to be created)
├── aegis_sdk/
│   ├── domain/
│   ├── application/
│   ├── ports/
│   └── infrastructure/
```

### Testing Standards
[Source: `architecture/testing-strategy.md`]:
- Test framework: **Pytest** (mandatory)
- Use fixtures instead of setUp/tearDown
- Use plain `assert` statements
- Test naming: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}`
- Use testcontainers for NATS integration testing
- Minimum 80% coverage, 100% for critical paths

### Important Implementation Note
**CRITICAL**: Performance testing infrastructure already exists! This story focuses on **validation and documentation** of existing implementation rather than creating new code. The Dev Agent should:
1. Verify all performance test files exist and are properly implemented
2. Execute the tests against the K8s NATS cluster
3. Document the actual performance metrics achieved
4. Compare results with Story 1.1 baseline
5. Generate comprehensive performance reports

### Special Considerations
- **Existing Implementation**: The performance benchmarks were already created during Story 1.1. This story ensures they meet all requirements and documents official baselines.
- **"ultrathink" Note**: The user mentioned "ultrathink" in the activation args. This term was not found in the codebase. If encountered during review, note it for future clarification.
- **Integration with K8s**: All performance tests must be executed against the Kubernetes-deployed NATS cluster (already running in aegis-trader namespace)
- **Port-forwarding Overhead**: Performance measurements should account for kubectl port-forward latency when testing against K8s cluster. Expected overhead: ~2-3ms additional latency.

### Testing

**Test Execution**:
- Run from `/packages/aegis-sdk/` directory
- Performance tests: `pytest performance/ -v --benchmark-only`
- Generate HTML report: `pytest performance/ --benchmark-autosave --benchmark-save-data`

**Performance Test Organization**:
```
performance/
├── conftest.py              # Shared fixtures for performance tests
├── test_rpc_performance.py  # RPC pattern benchmarks
├── test_event_performance.py # Event pattern benchmarks
├── run_performance_benchmarks.py # Automated test runner
└── results/                 # Benchmark results storage
```

**Key Metrics to Capture**:
1. **RPC Pattern**:
   - Request-response latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Maximum throughput (requests/second)
   - Queue group distribution efficiency
   - Serialization format impact
2. **Event Pattern**:
   - Publish latency
   - Maximum throughput (events/second)
   - JetStream acknowledgment overhead
   - Memory usage under load
