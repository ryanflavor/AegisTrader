# Story 0.3: Establish CI/CD Automation Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** an automated CI/CD pipeline
**so that** every code change is automatically tested, built, and deployed to the Kubernetes environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A CI/CD configuration file (e.g., for GitHub Actions) is present in the repository.
2. On every push to the main branch, the pipeline automatically runs all tests.
3. If tests pass, the pipeline builds and pushes new Docker images to a registry.
4. The pipeline automatically deploys the new images to a staging environment in Kubernetes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create GitHub Actions workflow structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
  - [x] Create main CI/CD workflow file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`)
  - [x] Configure workflow triggers for main branch pushes and PRs
  - [x] Set up environment variables and secrets management
- [x] Task 2: Implement automated testing stage (AC: 2)
  - [x] Configure Python environment setup with Python 3.13+
  - [x] Install all dependencies from requirements files

  - [x] Run mypy for type checking (100% annotation coverage)
  - [x] Run linting tools (ruff, black)
  - [x] Configure test result reporting
- [x] Task 3: Implement Docker build and push stage (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds
  - [x] Build ManagementService (FastAPI) image from `/apps/monitor-api/`
  - [x] Build MonitorUI (Next.js) image from `/apps/monitor-ui/`
  - [x] Configure image tagging strategy (e.g., git SHA, semantic versioning)
  - [x] Push images to container registry (GitHub Container Registry or DockerHub)
  - [x] Implement image scanning for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Task 4: Implement Kubernetes deployment stage (AC: 4)
  - [x] Configure kubectl and Helm in the pipeline
  - [x] Create staging namespace configuration
  - [x] Update Helm values for staging environment
  - [x] Deploy using Helm charts from `/helm/` directory
  - [x] Implement deployment verification checks
  - [x] Configure rollback strategy on deployment failure
- [x] Task 5: Create supporting CI/CD documentation
  - [x] Document pipeline architecture and stages
  - [x] Document environment variables and secrets required
  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common pipeline failures
  - [x] Document manual deployment override procedures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 0.1 implementation:
- Docker images successfully created for both ManagementService (FastAPI) and MonitorUI (Next.js)
- FastAPI application location: `/apps/monitor-api/` with port 8100
- Next.js application location: `/apps/monitor-ui/` with port 3100
- Docker build arguments may be needed for npm proxy issues
- Dockerfiles are already created and tested

From Story 0.2 implementation:
- Helm charts created in `/helm/` directory with parent chart and subcharts structure
- Deployment can be done with `make install` command from helm directory
- Environment-specific values files: `values.dev.yaml`, `values.docker-compose.yaml`
- Deployment configuration uses `.deploy.env` for environment variables
- NATS cluster with JetStream is deployed as part of the stack
- Automated deployment scripts exist: `generate-helm-values.sh`, `deploy.sh`

### CI/CD Technology Stack
**GitHub Actions** (latest version) is the mandated CI/CD platform [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#CI/CD Pipeline]

### Project Structure
The AegisTrader project follows a monorepo structure:
- Root directory: `/aegis-trading-system/` (or current working directory)
- Backend services: `/apps/` directory
- Core packages: `/packages/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Helm charts: `/helm/` directory (from Story 0.2)
- GitHub Actions workflows: `.github/workflows/` directory (to be created)

### Container Registry Strategy
For Story 0.3, the pipeline should:
- Use GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) as the default registry
- Image naming convention: `ghcr.io/{github-org}/aegis-trader/{service-name}:{tag}`
- Tag strategy:
  - Main branch: Use git SHA (first 7 characters) and `latest`
  - PR builds: Use `pr-{number}-{sha}`
  - Release tags: Use semantic versioning when tags are pushed

### Testing Requirements
**Python Testing Standards:**
- Test framework: **Pytest** (>=7.0.0) - mandatory, no other frameworks allowed [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Pytest Framework]
- Minimum 80% overall coverage, 100% for critical paths [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Coverage]
- Test naming: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Naming]
- Use pytest fixtures, NOT setUp/tearDown [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Pytest Framework]
- Use plain `assert` statements, NOT unittest assertions
- Integration tests must use **testcontainers** for NATS testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Testing]

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Python 3.13+ required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Python Version]
- 100% type annotation coverage enforced by mypy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Type Checking]
- All async I/O operations must use async/await [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Async Programming]
- Conventional Commits specification for all commits [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Commit Messages]

### Kubernetes Deployment Requirements
**From Story 0.2 Implementation:**
- Kubernetes cluster must be available (version 1.28+)
- Helm 3.x must be installed in the pipeline
- Deployment uses namespace isolation
- Environment-specific values are generated by `generate-helm-values.sh`
- Deployment verification includes:
  - NATS cluster health check
  - Service readiness probes
  - Pod status verification

**Staging Environment Configuration:**
- Create dedicated `aegis-staging` namespace
- Use staging-specific resource limits (reduced from production)
- Configure staging-specific ingress rules if needed
- Implement proper RBAC for CI/CD service account

### Security Considerations
- **Never** commit secrets or credentials to the repository
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values:
  - `REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` for container registry
  - `KUBE_CONFIG` for Kubernetes cluster access
  - Any API keys or tokens required
- Implement container image vulnerability scanning
- Use least-privilege principles for CI/CD service accounts

### Pipeline Stages Architecture
1. **Trigger Stage**: On push to main or PR events
2. **Test Stage**: Run all tests, linting, type checking
3. **Build Stage**: Build and scan Docker images
4. **Push Stage**: Push images to registry (only on main branch)
5. **Deploy Stage**: Deploy to staging (only on main branch)
6. **Verify Stage**: Run deployment verification tests

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Methodology]
- Test framework: Pytest (>=7.0.0) for Python backend [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Pytest Framework]
- Minimum 80% test coverage required [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Coverage]
- Test naming convention: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Naming]
- Integration tests must use testcontainers for external dependencies
