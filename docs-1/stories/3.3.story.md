# Story 3.3: Implement Automatic Failover

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** standby service instance,
**I want** to detect when the active instance has failed and participate in a new election,
**so that** the service can quickly recover.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. If a standby instance detects the leader's heartbeat key has expired (due to TTL), it triggers a new election.
2. A new leader is successfully elected and updates its status in the KV Store.
3. The entire failover process, from detection to the new leader being ready, completes in under 2 seconds.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.2 implementation:
- Client-side retry logic is implemented with exponential backoff for RPCErrorCode.NOT_ACTIVE errors
- RetryPolicy value object handles retry configuration with max retries (default: 3) and initial delay (default: 100ms)
- Clients automatically retry when receiving RPCErrorCode.NOT_ACTIVE responses from standby instances
- Metrics tracking is in place for retry attempts and failover latency
- The sticky active pattern is working end-to-end with client retry support
- Note: SDK now uses RPCErrorCode enum instead of hardcoded "NOT_ACTIVE" strings

From Story 3.1 implementation:
- SingleActiveService class manages sticky active state transitions
- NATS KV Store is used for service registration with TTL-based heartbeats
- Active instance is tracked via sticky_active_status field in ServiceInstance
- @exclusive_rpc decorator ensures only active instance processes requests
- Current implementation lacks automatic failover when active instance fails

### Data Models
ServiceInstance model fields [Source: architecture/data-models-schema-design.md]:
```python
class ServiceInstance(BaseModel):
    # Core identity
    service_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    instance_id: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    version: str = Field(...)

    # Status and health
    status: ServiceStatus = Field(
        default=ServiceStatus.ACTIVE,
        description="Service operational status"
    )
    last_heartbeat: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))

    # Sticky active fields (critical for failover)
    sticky_active_group: str | None = Field(default=None)
    sticky_active_status: StickyActiveStatus | None = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Leader election status for sticky active pattern"
    )
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

Key value objects and enums needed for failover:
```python
# Import required enums from domain.enums
from aegis_sdk.domain.enums import (
    ServiceStatus,
    StickyActiveStatus,
    RPCErrorCode
)

# ElectionState for tracking election progress
class ElectionState(BaseModel):
    state: Literal["IDLE", "DETECTING", "ELECTING", "ELECTED", "FAILED"]
    started_at: datetime | None = None
    completed_at: datetime | None = None
    attempts: int = 0
    last_error: str | None = None

# HeartbeatStatus for monitoring
class HeartbeatStatus(BaseModel):
    instance_id: str
    last_seen: datetime
    ttl_seconds: int
    is_expired: bool
    time_since_last: float
```

### API Specifications
NATS KV Store operations for failover [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- **Heartbeat Key**: `service.{service_name}.{instance_id}.heartbeat` with TTL
- **Leader Key**: `service.{service_name}.{group_id}.leader` for election
- **Instance Registry**: `service.{service_name}.{instance_id}` for status updates

KV Store operations required:
- `kv.watch()`: Monitor active instance heartbeat key for expiration
- `kv.create()`: Atomic creation of leader key (fails if exists)
- `kv.update()`: Update instance status with CAS for consistency
- `kv.get()`: Read current leader and instance states

RPC Error Handling:
```python
# Use RPCErrorCode enum for consistent error responses
if not is_active:
    return RPCResponse(
        success=False,
        error=RPCErrorCode.NOT_ACTIVE.value,
        message=f"Instance {instance_id} is in {StickyActiveStatus.STANDBY.value} mode"
    )
```

### Component Specifications
Following DDD architecture with hexagonal pattern [Source: architecture/ddd_v2.md]:

**Domain Layer:**
- ElectionState value object (immutable state tracking)
- HeartbeatStatus value object (health monitoring)
- FailoverPolicy value object (configuration)

**Application Layer:**
- MonitorHeartbeatUseCase (detect failures)
- TriggerElectionUseCase (initiate leader election)
- UpdateInstanceStatusUseCase (state transitions)

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- NATSHeartbeatMonitor (implements heartbeat watching)
- NATSElectionCoordinator (implements leader election)
- NATSKVRepository (KV Store operations)

**Ports/Adapters:**
- HeartbeatMonitorPort (interface for monitoring)
- ElectionCoordinatorPort (interface for elections)
- FailoverNotificationPort (interface for events)

### Technical Constraints
Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md & tech-stack.md]:
- Python 3.13+ with 100% type annotation coverage
- All async/await for NATS operations
- Pydantic v2 for all data models (no @dataclass)
- NATS KV Store as sole source of truth (no external database)
- Follow hexagonal architecture with clear port/adapter separation
- Use dependency injection for testability

Performance requirements [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- Failover must complete in under 2 seconds
- Heartbeat interval: 500ms (configurable)
- Election timeout: 1 second maximum
- Support for "strict low-latency and high-reliability requirements"

### Testing Requirements
Testing approach [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- TDD methodology: Write tests first, then implementation
- Use pytest with @pytest.mark.asyncio for async tests
- testcontainers for NATS in integration tests
- Test naming: test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}
- Minimum 80% coverage, 100% for critical failover logic

Critical test scenarios:
- test_heartbeat_expiration_triggers_election
- test_concurrent_election_single_winner
- test_failover_completes_under_two_seconds
- test_split_brain_prevention
- test_graceful_active_instance_shutdown
- test_network_partition_recovery
- test_rapid_failover_cycles

### Integration with Existing Code
Current SingleActiveService flow (from Story 3.1):
1. Service registers with sticky_active_group
2. First instance becomes active automatically
3. Subsequent instances become standby
4. No automatic failover on active instance failure

Enhanced flow with automatic failover:
1. All instances monitor active instance heartbeat
2. On heartbeat expiration, standby instances detect failure
3. Election coordinator initiates new leader election (status: StickyActiveStatus.ELECTING)
4. Winner updates status to StickyActiveStatus.ACTIVE, starts processing
5. Other instances remain/become StickyActiveStatus.STANDBY
6. Clients retry on RPCErrorCode.NOT_ACTIVE and connect to new active instance

### Key Implementation Considerations
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Use NATS KV CAS operations for atomic state changes
- **Split-Brain Avoidance**: Only one instance can hold the leader key at a time
- **Fast Detection**: Balance between false positives and quick failure detection
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with degraded performance during failover
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and metrics for debugging failovers
- **Testing Challenge**: Simulating real failures in integration tests requires careful timing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing services without failover continue to work

### Domain-Driven Design Principles
Following DDD principles from architecture [Source: architecture/ddd_v2.md]:

**Bounded Context**: Service Discovery and Coordination
- Clear boundary around sticky active service management
- Ubiquitous language: Election, Heartbeat, Failover, Leader, Standby

**Aggregates**:
- ServiceInstance as aggregate root maintaining consistency
- Election process as transactional boundary

**Domain Events**:
- LeaderElected
- HeartbeatExpired
- FailoverInitiated
- FailoverCompleted

**Invariants to Enforce**:
- Only one instance with StickyActiveStatus.ACTIVE per sticky_active_group
- Heartbeat must be updated before TTL expiration
- Election winner must be a healthy standby instance (ServiceStatus.ACTIVE or ServiceStatus.STANDBY)
- RPC errors must use RPCErrorCode enum values for consistency
