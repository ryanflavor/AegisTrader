# **Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy**

## **Enhancement Overview**

Enhancement Type: New Service Development.  
Scope: To build a multi-market real-time quote service that receives CTP (futures) and SOPT (stock options) data, validates it, publishes real-time Tick events, and stores aggregated minute-level K-lines (Bars) to a time-series database。  
Integration Impact: High. This is a new core service within the AegisTrader ecosystem.

## **Integration Approach**

Code Integration Strategy: The service will be built as a new, independent application package that depends on the aegis-sdk runtime library. It will follow the standard DDD project structure generated by aegis-sdk-dev。  
Database Integration: The service will write to a dedicated ClickHouse database for historical data and use the shared NATS KV Store for caching and real-time state。  
API Integration: The service acts as an adapter for external market data APIs (CTP, SOPT) and exposes its data to the rest of the ecosystem via NATS events and RPC calls, not a public REST/HTTP API。  
UI Integration: Not applicable. This is a backend service.

## **Compatibility Requirements**

* **Existing API Compatibility**: Must integrate with the existing NATS-based messaging schema defined in AegisSDK (RPCRequest, Event, etc.)。  
* **Database Schema Compatibility**: Will introduce new tables in ClickHouse and new key structures in NATS KV, designed not to conflict with other services。  
* **Performance Impact**: The service must meet high-performance targets, including \<1ms processing latency and \>50,000 TPS throughput, to avoid negatively impacting the trading ecosystem。
