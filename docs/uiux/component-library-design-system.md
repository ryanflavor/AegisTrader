# **6.0 Component Library / Design System**

* **Design System Approach**: We will use **Shadcn/ui**, a collection of composable and customizable components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, allowing for maximum design flexibility.  
* **Core Business Components**:  
  * **ServiceStatusBadge**: A colored badge to visually represent service status (ACTIVE, UNHEALTHY, STANDBY).  
  * **ServiceInstanceCard**: A component for the dashboard to display a summary of a single service instance.  
  * **MetricsChart**: A chart component for visualizing historical performance data.  
  * **DefinitionForm**: A form, composed of base Shadcn inputs and buttons, for creating and editing service definitions.  
  * **ConfirmDeleteDialog**: A modal used to confirm destructive actions.
