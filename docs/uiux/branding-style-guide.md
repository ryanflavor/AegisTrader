# **7.0 Branding & Style Guide**

* **Goal**: To create a clean, professional theme suitable for a technical tool, without complex branding.  
* **Color Palette**: The palette will consist of a neutral grayscale for text and backgrounds, a primary blue for interactive elements, and semantic colors (green for success/active, red for danger/unhealthy, gray for standby).  
* **Typography**: A modern, clean sans-serif font stack (e.g., Inter or system UI fonts) will be used to ensure readability. A clear type scale will establish visual hierarchy.  
* **Spacing**: A consistent 8px-based grid system will be used for all spacing and layout to ensure visual harmony.
