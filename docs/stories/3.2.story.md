# Story 3.2: Client-Side Optimizations for Sticky Active Pattern

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** AegisSDK client,
**I want** optimized retry logic and performance monitoring when calling sticky active services,
**so that** I experience minimal latency during failovers and have visibility into the pattern's performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The client automatically retries RPC calls that receive "NOT_ACTIVE" errors with configurable backoff.
2. The client tracks and exposes metrics for sticky active calls (retry counts, failover latency).
3. The client provides clear documentation and examples for using services with the sticky active pattern.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement smart retry logic for NOT_ACTIVE errors (AC: 1)
  - [x] Detect "NOT_ACTIVE" error string in RPCCallUseCase response
  - [x] Implement configurable retry policy (max retries, backoff strategy)
  - [x] Add exponential backoff with jitter to avoid thundering herd
  - [x] Ensure other errors are not retried (only "NOT_ACTIVE")
  - [x] Write unit tests for retry logic
- [x] Task 2: Add performance metrics for sticky active calls (AC: 2)
  - [x] Track retry attempts per RPC call
  - [x] Measure total failover latency (first call to successful response)
  - [x] Count NOT_ACTIVE errors vs successful calls
  - [x] Add metrics for sticky active pattern health
  - [x] Write tests for metrics collection
- [x] Task 3: Create client configuration for sticky behavior (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add StickyActiveConfig to SDK configuration
  - [x] Configure max retries (default: 3)
  - [x] Configure initial retry delay (default: 100ms)
  - [x] Configure backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
  - [x] Write configuration validation tests
- [x] Task 4: Implement client-side helpers and examples (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create example service using @exclusive_rpc decorator
  - [x] Create example client showing sticky call behavior
  - [x] Add documentation explaining the pattern and its benefits
  - [x] Include troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - [x] Write integration test demonstrating failover scenario
- [x] Task 5: Add observability for debugging (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Log retry attempts with instance details
  - [x] Add debug mode to trace sticky call routing
  - [x] Create diagnostic endpoint to check sticky active status
  - [x] Implement health check for sticky active services
  - [x] Write tests for observability features

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 implementation:
- Server-side sticky active pattern is fully implemented
- All instances receive RPC calls, but only active instance processes them
- Standby instances return `{"success": False, "error": "NOT_ACTIVE", "message": "..."}`
- No special client routing needed - standard `rpc.{service}.{method}` subjects work
- SingleActiveService class handles all server-side logic transparently
- Failover completes in < 2 seconds as verified by tests

### Data Models
Key fields from ServiceInstance model [Source: domain/models.py]:
```python
class ServiceInstance(BaseModel):
    # Core identity
    service_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    instance_id: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    version: str = Field(...)

    # Status and health
    status: str = Field(
        default=ServiceStatus.ACTIVE.value,
        pattern="^(ACTIVE|UNHEALTHY|STANDBY)$"
    )
    last_heartbeat: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))

    # Sticky active fields (added in Story 3.1)
    sticky_active_group: str | None = Field(default=None)
    sticky_active_status: str | None = Field(
        default=None,
        pattern="^(ACTIVE|STANDBY|ELECTING)$"
    )
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

Note: The model uses string fields with regex validation patterns that match the enum values. The SDK uses enums like `StickyActiveStatus.ACTIVE.value` when setting these fields to ensure type safety.

RPC Request/Response models [Source: domain/models.py]:
```python
class RPCRequest(BaseModel):
    method: str
    params: dict[str, Any]
    target: str | None = None  # Can specify target service

class RPCResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    result: Any | None = None
    error: str | None = None
```

### API Specifications
No new REST APIs required - this is internal SDK client functionality.

RPC Error Response for NOT_ACTIVE (current implementation):
```python
{
    "success": False,
    "error": "NOT_ACTIVE",  # Currently a hardcoded string
    "message": "Instance {instance_id} is in STANDBY mode for group {group_id}."
}
```

Note: The current implementation uses a hardcoded string "NOT_ACTIVE". While the SDK uses enums for other types (ServiceStatus, StickyActiveStatus), RPC errors are still using strings.

### Component Specifications
Following DDD architecture [Source: CLAUDE.md in aegis-sdk]:
- **Application Layer**: Enhanced RPCCallUseCase with retry logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Configuration management for sticky behavior
- **Domain Layer**: New RetryPolicy value object
- **Ports**: No changes needed to existing interfaces

```

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.13+ required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- 100% type annotation coverage mandatory
- Pydantic v2 for all data models
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Follow DDD principles and hexagonal architecture

### Testing Requirements
Testing standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Use pytest framework with @pytest.mark.asyncio
- Minimum 80% coverage overall, 100% for critical sticky routing logic
- Integration tests must use real NATS (no mocking)
- Test naming: test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}
- Use testcontainers for NATS in unit tests

Test scenarios to cover:
- Successful call to active instance (no retries needed)
- Retry on NOT_ACTIVE error until success
- Max retry limit reached
- Exponential backoff timing
- Concurrent calls during failover
- Metrics accuracy during retries
- Configuration validation

### Integration with Existing Code
Current RPC flow (unchanged):
1. Client calls `call_rpc` via use case or directly
2. NATS routes to all healthy instances
3. Active instance processes request, others return NOT_ACTIVE

Enhanced flow with retry:
1. Client calls `call_rpc` normally
2. If response has `error: "NOT_ACTIVE"`, retry with backoff
3. Continue until success or max retries reached
4. Track metrics for observability

### Key Implementation Considerations
- Retry ONLY on "NOT_ACTIVE" error string, not other errors
- Use exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Keep retry logic in application layer (use cases) for testability
- Default to 3 retries with 100ms initial delay
- Log retries at debug level to avoid log spam
- Consider circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

## QA Results

### Refactoring Results (2025-08-06)

**TDD Compliance Review:**
- ✅ Unit tests follow TDD principles with clear test cases
- ✅ Tests focus on actual functionality, not mocks
- ✅ Good coverage of edge cases and validation

**Hexagonal Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ Examples refactored to follow DDD and hexagonal architecture
- ✅ Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- ✅ Proper use of ports and adapters pattern
- ✅ Dependency injection container implemented

**Key Refactoring Changes:**

1. **sticky_active_service.py:**
   - Separated domain entities (Order, OrderStats)
   - Created domain ports (OrderRepositoryPort, OrderEventPublisherPort)
   - Implemented use cases (ProcessOrderUseCase, GetOrderStatsUseCase)
   - Added infrastructure adapters (InMemoryOrderRepository, NATSOrderEventPublisher)
   - Created ServiceContainer for dependency injection

2. **sticky_active_client.py:**
   - Created domain value objects (OrderRequest, OrderResult, ServiceStats, HealthStatus)
   - Defined OrderServicePort interface
   - Implemented client-side use cases
   - Added RPCOrderServiceAdapter as infrastructure layer
   - Created ClientContainer for dependency injection

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - Removed MagicMock usage, using real components
   - Tests connect to real K8s NATS on localhost:4222
   - Improved encapsulation by avoiding direct manipulation of internal state

**Testing Environment:**
- K8s port forwarding configured (NATS on localhost:4222)
- Tests run against real infrastructure
- No mocking of NATS or message bus

**Outstanding Issues:**
- Integration tests have challenges simulating failover scenarios due to the exclusive_rpc decorator implementation
- Recommendation: Consider adding test-specific hooks in SingleActiveService for better testability

**Recommendations:**
- Consider extracting the exclusive_rpc logic into a separate testable component
- Add integration test markers to pytest configuration
- Document the K8s testing setup in project README
