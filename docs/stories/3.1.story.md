# Story 3.1: Implement Sticky-Active Instance Election & Heartbeat

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As an** AegisSDK service cluster,
**I want** to elect a single "sticky active" instance for a service group and maintain its status via heartbeats,
**so that** there is always one designated instance for critical requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SingleActiveService class implements leader election for exclusive processing.
2. On startup, instances of this class use an atomic "create-or-get" operation on a designated NATS KV Store key to elect a leader.
3. Only the elected leader instance sets its status to `ACTIVE` in its `ServiceInstance` record in the KV Store.
4. Standby instances periodically monitor the leader's heartbeat key.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 implementation:
- KV Store watch functionality is available for real-time updates
- Caching patterns established for efficient KV access
- Integration test infrastructure already validates K8s connectivity

From Story 2.2 implementation:
- ServiceInstance model already includes status field
- Registry uses key pattern: `service-instances.{serviceName}.{instanceId}`
- Heartbeat mechanism implemented with TTL support

### Data Models
Current ServiceInstance model [Source: architecture/data-models-schema-design.md#3.2]:
```python
class ServiceInstance(BaseModel):
    service_name: str
    instance_id: str
    version: str
    status: Literal["ACTIVE", "UNHEALTHY", "STANDBY"]
    sticky_active_group: str | None = None  # Already supports sticky groups
    last_heartbeat: datetime
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

### API Specifications
No new REST APIs required - this is internal SDK functionality.

Service will integrate with existing service registry patterns.

### Component Specifications
Following DDD architecture [Source: CLAUDE.md in aegis-sdk]:
- **Domain Layer**: New aggregates and value objects for sticky active pattern
- **Application Layer**: SingleActiveService with sticky-active use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: NATS KV Store-based election repository
- **Ports**: ElectionRepository interface for abstraction

```

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.13+ required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- 100% type annotation coverage mandatory
- Pydantic v2 for all data models
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Follow DDD principles and hexagonal architecture

### Testing Requirements
Testing standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Use pytest framework with @pytest.mark.asyncio
- Minimum 80% coverage overall, 100% for critical election logic
- Integration tests must use real NATS (no mocking)
- Test naming: test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}
- K8s tests must validate < 2 second failover requirement

K8s testing approach:
- Use existing Kind cluster (aegis-local)
- Deploy test instances using Helm charts
- Use chaos engineering tools to test failure scenarios
- Monitor election events via NATS CLI tools

### DDD Implementation Guidelines
Following DDD prompt guidance [Source: architecture/ddd_prompt.md]:
- Domain Events: LeaderElected, LeaderLost, ElectionStarted, ElectionFailed
- Commands: RequestLeadership, ReleaseLeadership, UpdateHeartbeat
- Aggregates: StickyActiveElection with consistency boundaries
- Value Objects: LeaderKey, ElectionTimeout, ServiceGroupId

### Integration Test Requirements
Following test agent guidelines [Source: .bmad-core/agents/test.md]:
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD approach)
- Test behaviors and outcomes, not implementation details
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Ensure tests are independent and deterministic
- Use testcontainers for NATS in unit tests
- Use real K8s cluster for integration tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent adherence to Domain-Driven Design principles and hexagonal architecture. The sticky active election pattern has been properly implemented using NATS KV Store with atomic operations, providing robust leader election and failover capabilities. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns across domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: aegis_sdk/application/sticky_active_use_cases.py
  - **Change**: Replaced direct service instance reference with callback pattern
  - **Why**: The monitoring use case was violating clean architecture by directly accessing a service instance through `_service_instance` attribute
  - **How**: Introduced a `status_callback` parameter that follows the dependency inversion principle, allowing the service layer to be notified of status changes without creating coupling

- **File**: aegis_sdk/application/single_active_service.py
  - **Change**: Added `_update_active_status` callback method
  - **Why**: To properly integrate with the refactored monitoring use case
  - **How**: The callback method updates the `is_active` flag when leadership status changes, maintaining clean separation between layers

- **File**: aegis_sdk/application/sticky_active_use_cases.py
  - **Change**: Extracted `_handle_leader_expired` and `_publish_leader_elected_event` methods
  - **Why**: The `_monitor_leadership` method had cyclomatic complexity of 12 (exceeding the limit of 10)
  - **How**: Broke down the complex method into smaller, focused methods that handle specific responsibilities

- **File**: aegis_sdk/application/single_active_service.py
  - **Change**: Fixed line length violations by properly formatting long strings
  - **Why**: Lines exceeded 100 character limit
  - **How**: Split long f-strings across multiple lines using proper Python string concatenation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All refactored code follows PEP 8 and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized following hexagonal architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed architectural violation with direct service instance access
[x] Reduced cyclomatic complexity in monitoring method
[x] Fixed all linting issues (line length, complexity)
[x] Maintained clean separation between layers
[ ] Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging failover scenarios
[ ] Consider making failover delay configurable per service instance
[ ] Add metrics for election attempt counts and retry patterns

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly uses atomic operations for leader election, preventing race conditions. TTL mechanisms ensure automatic cleanup of expired leaders.

### Performance Considerations

The implementation is efficient with:
- Minimal overhead for heartbeat operations (configurable intervals)
- Watch-based monitoring reduces polling overhead
- Proper use of async/await for non-blocking operations
- Configurable TTLs allow tuning for different deployment scenarios

The < 2 second failover requirement is achievable with current implementation as demonstrated in tests.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation successfully delivers a robust sticky active pattern with clean architecture, proper DDD principles, and efficient failover capabilities. The refactoring improved code quality without changing functionality.
