# Story 2.4: Integration Showcase

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to demonstrate all implemented features working together in a real Kubernetes environment,
**so that** we can validate the complete system integration before implementing Epic 3.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deploy a complete working system to Kubernetes with all Epic 0-2 features functioning.
2. Demonstrate at least 3 different service instances registering and maintaining heartbeats.
3. Show the Management API successfully performing CRUD operations on service definitions.
4. Demonstrate service discovery working with multiple instances and automatic failover.
5. Show real-time monitoring of all services through the Monitor UI.
6. Validate performance metrics meet NFR requirements (p99 latency not degraded >10%).
7. Document the complete deployment process and provide demo scripts.

## Dev Notes

### Current K8s Environment Status
As of development start:
- Kind cluster running (aegis-local-control-plane, v1.27.3)
- NATS cluster: 3 nodes running with JetStream enabled
- Monitor API: Running on ClusterIP 10.96.120.184:8100
- Monitor UI: Running on ClusterIP 10.96.164.150:3100
- NATS Box: Available for CLI operations
- Makefile commands available for deployment automation

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 implementation:
- Service discovery with caching is fully implemented
- KV Store watch functionality enables real-time updates
- Multiple selection strategies available (round-robin, random, sticky)
- Integration tests already validate K8s environment connectivity

From Story 2.2 implementation:
- Service registration with heartbeats working
- ServiceInstance model includes health status tracking
- Registry uses key pattern: `service-instances.{serviceName}.{instanceId}`

From Story 2.1 implementation:
- Management API with CRUD operations complete
- FastAPI endpoints secured and functional
- NATS KV Store integration tested

### Data Models
ServiceInstance model available [Source: Story 2.2 Dev Notes]:
```python
class ServiceInstance(BaseModel):
    service_name: str
    instance_id: str
    version: str
    status: Literal["ACTIVE", "UNHEALTHY", "STANDBY"]
    last_heartbeat: datetime
    sticky_active_group: str | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

ServiceDefinition model [Source: Story 2.1 implementation]:
- Stored in Management API domain models
- Used for CRUD operations via REST API

### API Specifications
Management API endpoints [Source: Story 2.1]:
- `POST /api/services` - Create service definition
- `GET /api/services` - List all services
- `GET /api/services/{service_name}` - Get specific service
- `PUT /api/services/{service_name}` - Update service
- `DELETE /api/services/{service_name}` - Delete service

Service Discovery API [Source: Story 2.3]:
- Integrated into Service.call_rpc() method
- Automatic discovery with caching
- Configurable selection strategies

### Component Specifications
Monitor UI requirements [Source: docs/uiux/*]:
- Next.js application at `/apps/monitor-ui/`
- Dashboard layout with service instance cards [Source: uiux/wireframes-mockups.md#5.1]
- Service Detail View with tabbed interface [Source: uiux/wireframes-mockups.md#5.2]
- Use Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS [Source: uiux/component-library-design-system.md]
- Real-time updates for operational efficiency [Source: uiux/overall-ux-goals-principles.md#2.2]

UI Component Specifications [Source: uiux/component-library-design-system.md]:
- **ServiceStatusBadge**: Colored badge for ACTIVE (green), UNHEALTHY (red), STANDBY (gray)
- **ServiceInstanceCard**: Dashboard component showing service instance summary
- **MetricsChart**: Visualize historical performance data
- **DefinitionForm**: Form for CRUD operations on service definitions
- **ConfirmDeleteDialog**: Modal for destructive action confirmation

Design Principles [Source: uiux/overall-ux-goals-principles.md#2.3]:
- Clarity Over Cleverness - prioritize clear communication
- Progressive Disclosure - show only what's needed
- Consistent Patterns - use familiar UI patterns
- Immediate Feedback - clear response to every action

Visual Design [Source: uiux/branding-style-guide.md]:
- Color Palette: Neutral grayscale, primary blue for interactive, semantic colors
- Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or system UI fonts)
- Spacing: 8px-based grid system for consistency

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
/apps/
├── monitor-api/          # Management API (FastAPI)
├── monitor-ui/           # Monitoring UI (Next.js)
└── trading-service/      # Example services go here

/packages/
├── aegis-sdk/           # Core SDK with all features
└── shared-contracts/    # Shared type definitions

/helm/                   # Helm charts for deployment
├── templates/
└── values.yaml
```

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.13+ required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- 100% type annotation coverage mandatory
- Pydantic v2 for all data models
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Pytest framework for testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Testing Requirements
Testing standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: tests/ directory in each package/app
- Minimum 80% coverage overall, 100% for critical paths
- Use pytest with async support (@pytest.mark.asyncio)
- Integration tests must use real NATS (no mocking)
- Test naming: test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}

K8s testing approach:
- Use existing Kind cluster (aegis-local)
- Deploy with: `make dev-deploy` or `make dev-update`
- Port forward: `make dev-forward` or `make port-forward`
- Connect to: `nats://localhost:4222`
- Current deployment: 3-node NATS cluster, monitor-api, monitor-ui
- Namespace: aegis-trader

### Course Correction Notes
During Task 1 completion, discovered that K8s integration tests require shared contracts for proper event validation. Services use specific event patterns (e.g., `trading.order.created`) but lack type-safe contracts. Added subtasks to create shared-contracts package as already planned in architecture docs. This ensures:
- Type-safe event communication between services
- Consistent event schemas across all services
- Proper integration test validation
- Foundation for future Epic 3 & 4 features

### Completion Notes List
- Completed Task 1: Created three example trading services (OrderService, PricingService, RiskService)
- Each service implements echo, health, and simulate_work RPC endpoints
- OrderService: Manages orders with create_order, get_order, list_orders endpoints; subscribes to risk events
- PricingService: Provides pricing data with get_price, get_prices endpoints; emits periodic price updates
- RiskService: Assesses order risk with assess_risk, get_positions, update_limits endpoints; monitors positions
- All services include service-specific metrics collection using MetricsPort
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all three services with high coverage
- Configured main.py to support running multiple instances (2-3) of each service type
- Services integrate with service registry for heartbeats and service discovery for RPC calls
- Created shared-contracts package with technical contracts only (not business models)
- Implemented parse_event_pattern utility to convert event patterns to domain/type pairs
- Updated all services to use standardized event patterns (events.{domain}.{action})
- Fixed all unit tests to use new event patterns instead of old trading.* patterns
- Created integration tests to validate event contracts and patterns
- Verified all services emit events with correct domain/type structure
- Confirmed parse_event_pattern utility works with all defined patterns
- Completed Task 3: Created K8s integration tests for all required scenarios
- Fixed consumer name conflicts by using unique instance IDs and SimpleTestService
- Validated service registration, discovery, RPC communication, and event flow in K8s
- All integration tests pass successfully against live K8s NATS cluster
