# Story 1.1: Core Feature Correctness Validation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to verify that all existing SDK features are working correctly and have adequate test coverage,
**so that** we have a stable foundation for new enhancements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Executing the full `pytest` suite passes without errors.
2. The code coverage report shows at least 90% coverage for the core SDK logic.
3. A QA review confirms that RPC, Event, and Command patterns function as described in the `README.md`.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 0 implementation (considering epic0 integration as requested):
- CI/CD pipeline established with pytest execution on every push (Story 0.3)
- Docker containerization completed for all services (Story 0.1)
- Kubernetes deployment with NATS cluster operational (Story 0.2)
- Testing must integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline
- NATS is deployed as part of the Kubernetes stack and available for integration testing

### SDK Core Features to Validate
Based on the AegisSDK README.md, the following features must be thoroughly tested:

**Communication Patterns** [Source: packages/aegis-sdk/README.md]:
1. **RPC (Request-Response)**
   - NATS request-reply pattern implementation
   - Queue group load balancing
   - Timeout handling (default 5s)
   - JSON and MessagePack serialization
   - Error propagation

2. **Event Publishing**
   - NATS JetStream integration
   - Durable subscriptions
   - Wildcard pattern matching
   - At-least-once delivery
   - Event versioning

3. **Command Processing**
   - JetStream work queues
   - Progress tracking callbacks
   - Priority-based execution
   - Retry policies
   - Completion notifications

**Core Components** [Source: packages/aegis-sdk/README.md]:
- `domain/models.py`: Pydantic models (Message, RPCRequest, Event, Command)
- `domain/patterns.py`: Subject pattern management
- `application/service.py`: Service base class with decorators
- `application/metrics.py`: Simple metrics collection
- `ports/message_bus.py`: MessageBusPort interface
- `infrastructure/nats_adapter.py`: NATS implementation

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
/aegis-trading-system/
|-- packages/
|   |-- aegis-sdk/          # The core AegisSDK
|       |-- tests/          # Test directory (to be used/created)
|       |-- domain/
|       |-- application/
|       |-- ports/
|       |-- infrastructure/
```

### Technical Requirements
**Python Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Python 3.13+ required
- 100% type annotation coverage (enforced by mypy)
- Pydantic v2 for all data entities
- All I/O operations must use async/await

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test framework: **Pytest** (>=7.0.0) - mandatory
- Minimum 80% overall coverage, 100% for critical paths
- Use testcontainers for NATS integration testing
- Test naming: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}`
- Use pytest fixtures (NOT setUp/tearDown)
- Use plain `assert` statements (NOT unittest assertions)
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple test cases

### Testing

**Test Execution Requirements**:
- Tests must be run from `/packages/aegis-sdk/` directory
- Coverage command: `pytest --cov=aegis_sdk --cov-report=html --cov-report=term`
- All tests must pass in the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Integration tests require NATS server (use testcontainers)

**Critical Paths Requiring 100% Coverage**:
1. All RPC request/response handling
2. Event publishing and subscription
3. Command processing lifecycle
4. Error handling and propagation
5. Connection management and failover
6. Message serialization/deserialization

**Test Organization**:
