# Story 1.1: Core Feature Correctness Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to verify that all existing SDK features are working correctly and have adequate test coverage,
**so that** we have a stable foundation for new enhancements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Executing the full `pytest` suite passes without errors.
2. The code coverage report shows at least 90% coverage for the core SDK logic.
3. A QA review confirms that RPC, Event, and Command patterns function as described in the `README.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Verify current test suite execution (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Navigate to packages/aegis-sdk directory
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Run pytest with verbose output to check all tests pass
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Document any failing tests or errors encountered
- [ ] Task 2: Measure and analyze test coverage (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Install pytest-cov if not already present
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Run pytest with coverage report (pytest --cov=aegis_sdk --cov-report=html --cov-report=term)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Verify coverage meets 90% threshold for core SDK logic
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Identify any gaps in coverage and document them
- [ ] Task 3: Validate core communication patterns (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Review README.md to understand expected behavior of RPC, Event, and Command patterns
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create test scripts or use existing examples to validate RPC pattern functionality
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Create test scripts or use existing examples to validate Event pattern functionality
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Create test scripts or use existing examples to validate Command pattern functionality
  - [ ] Subtask 3.5: Document validation results and any discrepancies found

## Dev Notes
### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#lines 5-14]
The AegisSDK is located in `/aegis-trading-system/packages/aegis-sdk/`. This is where all tests and SDK core logic reside.

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#lines 1-7]
- **Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% overall test coverage required, with 100% coverage for critical paths and business logic
- **Integration Testing**: Must use testcontainers to test against real dependencies like NATS (no mocking of core external services)
- **Test Naming**: Test functions must follow the test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior} convention

### Technical Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#lines 4-15]
- **Backend Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest >=7.0.0 (standard testing framework with async testing support)
- **Core Messaging**: NATS & JetStream 2.9+ (provides RPC, events, commands, and persistence)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#lines 3-8]
- **Python Version**: 3.13+ is required
- **Type Checking**: 100% type annotation coverage is mandatory, enforced by mypy
- **Entity Specification**: Pydantic v2 is the sole standard for data entities
- **Async Programming**: All I/O operations must use async/await syntax

### Testing
Test files should be located within the packages/aegis-sdk directory following pytest conventions (test_*.py or *_test.py files).

The developer must ensure:
- All tests follow the test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior} naming convention
- Integration tests use testcontainers for NATS testing (no mocking)
- Coverage report must show at least 90% coverage for core SDK logic
- All async operations are properly tested with pytest async support
