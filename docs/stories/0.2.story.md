# Story 0.2: Deploy Kubernetes Base Environment

## Status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 0.1 implementation:
- Docker images successfully created for both ManagementService (FastAPI) and MonitorUI (Next.js)
- FastAPI runs on port 8100, Next.js runs on port 3100
- NPM proxy issues were resolved using Docker build arguments
- Docker-compose.yaml already exists for local orchestration reference
- Both applications have basic health check endpoints ready
- **Note**: FastAPI service registration to NATS KV Store is NOT implemented yet (will be in Epic 2)

### Infrastructure Requirements
**Containerization & Orchestration:**
- Docker (latest version) for container images [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Containerization]
- Kubernetes 1.28+ for orchestration (supports native sidecar containers) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Orchestration]
- Helm 3.x as IaC tool (Helm 2 is deprecated) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#IaC Tool]

**Core Platform Requirements:**
- NATS & JetStream 2.9+ as messaging platform [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Messaging]
- NATS KV Store for service registry implementation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Service Registry]
- All services must connect to NATS for service registry functionality

**Image Registry Strategy:**
- For local development: Use local Docker daemon (no push required)
- Images referenced in Helm charts using:
  ```yaml
  image: aegis-trader/monitor-api:latest  # Local build tag
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent           # Avoids registry pulls
  ```
- Production registry configuration deferred to CI/CD pipeline (Story 0.3)

### Helm Chart Structure
Based on Helm 3 best practices and monorepo structure:
- Helm charts in `/helm/` directory at project root
- Use subchart pattern for service encapsulation and reusability
- Parent chart manages dependencies via Chart.yaml (requirements.yaml deprecated in Helm 3)
- Use semantic versioning with patch-level constraints (e.g., "~1.3.0")
- Commit Chart.lock file for reproducible deployments
- Create reusable templates in _helpers.tpl for consistency

### NATS Configuration Details
**Official NATS Helm Chart (v1.3.x):**
- Repository: `https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/`
- JetStream configuration in values.yaml:
  ```yaml
  nats:
    jetstream:
      enabled: true
    container:
      env:
        GOMEMLIMIT: 7GiB  # ~90% of memory limit
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: 8Gi
        limits:
          cpu: "2"
          memory: 8Gi
  ```
- Production cluster configuration:
  - 3 replicas minimum for HA
  - Pod topology spread constraints for distribution
  - FileStore PVC size: 10Gi minimum
  - ClusterIP service with pod readiness checks

**NATS KV Store Setup:**
- KV buckets created via post-install Helm hook or init job
- Bucket name: `service-registry` for AegisSDK integration
- Configure appropriate retention and replication settings

**Local Development Storage:**
- For local K8s (minikube/kind), use default storage class:
  ```yaml
  # values.dev.yaml
  nats:
    nats:
      jetstream:
        fileStorage:
          storageClassName: standard  # Default for minikube/kind
          size: 5Gi                  # Reduced for local dev
  ```
- No additional StorageClass configuration needed for local testing
- Production storage class configuration handled separately

### Application Configuration
**ManagementService (FastAPI):**
- Container port: 8100
- Environment variables via ConfigMap:
  - NATS_URL: `nats://{{ .Release.Name }}-nats:4222`
  - NATS_KV_BUCKET: `service-registry`
- Health check probes:
  - Startup probe: 60s failure threshold for JetStream connection
  - Readiness probe: 30s initial delay for full initialization
  - Liveness probe: HTTP GET /health every 10s
- Init container for NATS dependency using netcat

**MonitorUI (Next.js):**
- Container port: 3100
- Environment variables:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Service DNS name for API
- Health probes on root path or /api/health
- Init container waits for API readiness
- Ingress with optional TLS termination

### Deployment Best Practices
**Service Dependencies & Startup Order:**
- Init containers run sequentially before main containers
- Use netcat (nc) for TCP connectivity checks
- Readiness probes prevent traffic until services ready
- Helm hooks for deployment ordering:
  - pre-install: Create namespace, PVCs
  - post-install: Create KV buckets, run tests
  - Hook weights control execution order

**Resource Management:**
- Define both requests and limits for predictable performance
- Use Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) for HA
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling for production

**Testing Strategy:**
- `helm lint` for chart validation
- `helm template` for manifest verification
- Helm test templates for post-deployment validation
- Integration with CI/CD tools (Terratest, Chart Testing)

**Secrets Management (Basic):**
- For Story 0.2, use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Sensitive data handling:
  ```yaml
  # Future consideration (not in scope for 0.2):
  # - NATS credentials: Use K8s Secrets in production
  # - TLS certificates: cert-manager integration
  ```
- Current scope: All services use unauthenticated NATS for local development
- Production secrets management deferred to future stories

**Network Policy Consideration:**
- **Decision**: NOT implementing NetworkPolicies in Story 0.2
- **Rationale**: 
  - Adds complexity without immediate security benefit in dev environment
  - All services need NATS connectivity (port 4222)
  - Focus on functional deployment first
  - Network segmentation can be added when security requirements are defined

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Methodology]
- Minimum 80% test coverage required [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Coverage]
- Test naming convention: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Naming]

**Helm Chart Testing Approach:**
1. **Static Analysis:**
   - `helm lint ./helm/` - Validates chart syntax and best practices
   - `helm template` - Renders templates to catch templating errors
   - `yamllint` - Ensures YAML formatting standards

2. **Unit Testing:**
   - Create test values files: `values.test.yaml`
   - Test edge cases with different value combinations
   - Verify template output matches expectations

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Deploy to local cluster (kind/minikube/k3s)
   - Use Helm test templates in `templates/tests/`:
     ```yaml
     # templates/tests/nats-connection-test.yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-nats-test"
       annotations:
         "helm.sh/hook": test
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: nats-test
         image: nats:alpine
         command: ['nats', 'server', 'check', 'connection']
       restartPolicy: Never
     ```
   - Run tests: `helm test aegis-trader --timeout 5m`

4. **Service Connectivity Tests:**
   - NATS cluster formation verification
   - JetStream enabled and KV bucket accessible
   - FastAPI can connect to NATS
   - UI can reach API endpoints
   - End-to-end data flow validation

5. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Chart Testing (ct) tool for automated PR validation
   - Terratest for advanced infrastructure testing
   - GitHub Actions workflow for chart validation
