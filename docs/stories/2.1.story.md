## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- K8s NATS cluster is already deployed with 3-node HA configuration [Source: Story 1.2 Dev Notes]
- NATS service available at `aegis-trader-nats:4222` within cluster
- JetStream and KV Store are enabled with 10Gi storage
- For local development, use port-forwarding: `kubectl port-forward svc/aegis-trader-nats 4222:4222`
- Integration tests should be based on the Epic 0 K8s infrastructure
- Note: "ultrathink" mentioned by user was not found in codebase during Story 1.2 review

### Data Models
ServiceDefinition schema [Source: architecture/data-models-schema-design.md#ServiceDefinition]:
```typescript
export interface ServiceDefinition {
  serviceName: string;
  owner: string;
  description: string;
  version: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```
- All fields are required strings
- serviceName serves as the unique identifier
- Timestamps should be ISO 8601 format
- Must use Pydantic v2 for Python implementation

**Validation Rules & Constraints**:
- `serviceName`: Pattern `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{2,63}$` (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens, 3-64 chars)
- `owner`: Max length 100 characters
- `description`: Max length 500 characters
- `version`: Semantic versioning pattern `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`
- `createdAt/updatedAt`: ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., "2025-08-02T10:30:00Z")
- Duplicate serviceName on POST should return 409 Conflict

### API Specifications
RESTful API Contract [Source: architecture/api-interface-contracts.md#Management Service]:
- Base path: `/api`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /services` - List all service definitions
  - `POST /services` - Create new service definition
  - `PUT /services/{serviceName}` - Update existing service definition
  - `DELETE /services/{serviceName}` - Delete service definition
- All endpoints must return proper HTTP status codes
- Response format: JSON with appropriate content-type headers

**HTTP Status Codes**:
- `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT operations
- `201 Created`: Successful POST with Location header
- `204 No Content`: Successful DELETE
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data or validation failure
- `404 Not Found`: Service definition not found
- `409 Conflict`: Duplicate serviceName on POST or concurrent update
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Request validation errors
- `500 Internal Server Error`: NATS connection failures

**Error Response Format**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Service name must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens",
    "details": {
      "field": "serviceName",
      "value": "Invalid-Name"
    }
  }
}

### Component Specifications
No specific UI component details for this story as it's backend-only.

│   └── conftest.py          # Pytest fixtures
└── pyproject.toml           # Project dependencies
```

### Technical Constraints
- Python version: 3.13+ required [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Framework: FastAPI latest version [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Type annotations: 100% coverage mandatory, use `from __future__ import annotations`
- Data validation: Pydantic v2 only, @dataclass forbidden
- Async: All I/O operations must use async/await
- NATS version: 2.9+ with JetStream enabled
- Service Registry: NATS KV Store (no external database)

**Network Security**:
- Internal network only - no authentication required
- Service runs within secure K8s cluster
- Access controlled via Kubernetes network policies
- No rate limiting needed for internal services

**Concurrency & Atomicity**:
- Use NATS KV Store revision for optimistic locking on updates
- PUT operations must include current revision in request
- Return 409 Conflict if revision mismatch (concurrent update)
- KV Store operations are atomic by default
- Connection pooling with max 10 concurrent NATS connections

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework**: Pytest (mandatory) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Use fixtures instead of setUp/tearDown
- Use plain `assert` statements, NOT unittest assertions
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for multiple test cases

**Test Organization**:
```
/apps/monitor-api/tests/
├── integration/
│   └── test_services_api.py    # API endpoint tests
└── conftest.py                 # Shared fixtures
```

**Testing Standards**:
- Minimum 80% overall coverage, 100% for API endpoints
- Use testcontainers for NATS integration testing
- Test naming: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}`
- No mocking of NATS - use real containerized instance
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify proper HTTP status codes and error messages

**Integration Test Requirements**:
- Must test against containerized NATS with KV Store enabled
- Test CRUD operations with various payloads
- Test concurrent operations and race conditions
- Verify KV Store persistence across operations

**Specific Test Scenarios**:
1. **Happy Path Tests**:
   - Create, read, update, delete service definitions
   - List all services with proper pagination
   - Verify timestamps are correctly set
2. **Validation Tests**:
   - Invalid serviceName patterns
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid version formats
   - Field length exceeding limits
3. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - NATS connection failures
   - Duplicate serviceName on POST
   - Update/delete non-existent services
   - Concurrent update conflicts
4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Response time < 100ms for single operations
   - Handle 100 concurrent requests without degradation
