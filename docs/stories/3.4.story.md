# Story 3.4: SDK Developer Experience and Testing Tools

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer using the AegisSDK,
**I want** user-friendly configuration helpers and ready-to-use test examples that work with my local K8s environment,
**so that** I can quickly understand and test client-service interactions without dealing with complex setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Developers can connect to the existing K8s NATS cluster (aegis-trader namespace) with minimal configuration.
2. A set of example client and service implementations demonstrate the two fundamental patterns:
   - Load-Balanced Service Pattern (using base Service class)
   - Sticky Single-Active Pattern (using SingleActiveService with client-side retry)
3. Helper utilities automatically discover NATS connection details from K8s and configure the SDK.
4. Clear quickstart guide shows how to run examples against the local K8s environment in under 5 minutes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 (Automatic Failover):
- K8s integration tests successfully connect to localhost:4222 (port-forwarded NATS)
- SingleActiveService with FailoverPolicy working in K8s environment
- Sub-2-second failover achieved in K8s tests (1.06 seconds)
- NATS KV Store used for service registry and leader election

From Story 3.3b (Monitor-API SDK Compatibility):
- Monitor-api is an EXTERNAL CLIENT, not a service itself
- Clear distinction between management plane (monitor-api) and data plane (services)
- SDK provides infrastructure components for both patterns
- Extended metadata fields available in ServiceInstance for observability

From existing K8s deployment (verified):
- NATS StatefulSet: `aegis-trader-nats-0` (2/2 containers ready)
- Monitor API: `aegis-trader-monitor-api` on port 8100
- Monitor UI: `aegis-trader-monitor-ui` on port 3100
- NATS box for debugging: `aegis-trader-nats-box`
- Services exposed: `aegis-trader-nats` (ClusterIP on port 4222)

### Data Models
Configuration models needed [Source: architecture/data-models-schema-design.md]:
```python
class SDKConfig(BaseModel):
    """Simplified SDK configuration for developers."""
    service_name: str = Field(..., description="Your service name")
    nats_url: str = Field(default="auto", description="NATS URL or 'auto' for K8s discovery")
    environment: Literal["local-k8s", "docker", "production"] = Field(default="local-k8s")
    debug: bool = Field(default=True, description="Enable debug logging")

class K8sNATSConfig(BaseModel):
    """K8s-specific NATS configuration."""
    namespace: str = Field(default="aegis-trader")
    service_name: str = Field(default="aegis-trader-nats")
    port: int = Field(default=4222)
    use_port_forward: bool = Field(default=True)
```

### API Specifications
K8s Service Discovery [Verified from actual K8s cluster]:
- K8s Service Name: `aegis-trader-nats`
- K8s Namespace: `aegis-trader`
- Service Port: `4222/TCP` (named "nats")
- In-cluster URL: `aegis-trader-nats.aegis-trader.svc.cluster.local:4222`
- Port-forward command: `kubectl port-forward -n aegis-trader svc/aegis-trader-nats 4222:4222`
- Local access URL: `nats://localhost:4222` (after port-forwarding)
- NATS Config: JetStream enabled with 1Gi file store

Helper utilities API:
```python
# Auto-configuration helper
async def create_service(name: str, **kwargs) -> Service:
    """Create a service with automatic K8s configuration."""
    config = await discover_k8s_config()
    return Service(name, config, **kwargs)

# Test runner
async def run_test_scenario(scenario: str) -> TestResults:
    """Run predefined test scenarios against K8s environment."""
    pass
```

### Component Specifications
Following DDD architecture [Source: architecture/ddd_v2.md]:

**Application Layer** (Developer Tools):
- QuickstartGenerator: Scaffolds new SDK projects
- ConfigurationHelper: Auto-discovers and validates config
- TestScenarioRunner: Executes test scenarios
- ServiceExplorer: Interactive service discovery tool
- PatternSelector: Helps choose between Service vs External Client pattern

**Infrastructure Layer** (K8s Integration):
- K8sServiceDiscovery: Discovers NATS from K8s API
- PortForwardManager: Manages kubectl port-forwarding
- K8sConfigLoader: Loads kubeconfig and context

**Example Services** (Data Plane - demonstrating the 2 fundamental patterns):

1. **Load-Balanced Service Pattern Examples** (Base Service):
   - `EchoService` (Base Service + RPC):
     * Pattern: Multiple active instances, load-balanced RPC
     * Use case: Stateless request/response, horizontal scaling
     * Client calls → SDK picks one instance → Returns response

2. **Sticky Single-Active Pattern Examples** (SingleActiveService + Client Retry):
   - `EchoSingleService` (SingleActiveService + Client-side retry):
     * Pattern: Single active instance with automatic client retry on NOT_ACTIVE
     * Use case: Testing failover, ordered processing, debugging
     * Client calls → If NOT_ACTIVE, client retries → Only leader processes

3. **Event Pattern Examples**:
   - `EventPublisher` (Base Service + Event Publishing):
     * Pattern: Any instance can publish events
     * Use case: Generating events from multiple sources
     * Publishes to topics like "orders.created", "payments.processed"

   - `EventSubscriber` (Base Service + Event Subscription):
     * Pattern: Multiple subscription modes
     * COMPETE mode: Only one instance processes each event (load balanced)
     * BROADCAST mode: All instances receive all events
     * EXCLUSIVE mode: Only one specific instance receives events

4. **Stateful Service Examples** (Sticky Single-Active Pattern):
   - `OrderProcessor` (SingleActiveService + Client Retry):
     * Pattern: Sticky Single-Active with leader election and client retry
     * Use case: Order processing requiring consistency
     * Client automatically retries on NOT_ACTIVE errors until leader processes
     * Maintains order state, ensures exactly-once processing

   - `InventoryManager` (SingleActiveService + Client Retry):
     * Pattern: Single writer with automatic failover via client retry
     * Use case: Managing limited resources, preventing conflicts
     * Only leader can modify inventory, clients retry if hitting standby instance

5. **Observability Examples**:
   - `MetricsCollector` (Base Service + Metadata Enrichment):
     * Pattern: Enriches ServiceInstance.metadata with metrics
     * Use case: Collecting and exposing service metrics
     * Adds performance data to metadata for monitoring

   - `HealthReporter` (Base Service + Health Checks):
     * Pattern: Custom health check implementation
     * Use case: Complex health validation beyond heartbeats
     * Reports detailed health status to registry

**Example Tools** (Management Plane - using infrastructure directly):
- ServiceInspector: External tool to read service instances (like monitor-api)
- MetricsAggregator: External tool to collect metrics from metadata
- HealthChecker: External tool to monitor service heartbeats

### Technical Constraints
Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md & tech-stack.md]:
- Python 3.13+ with full type annotations
- All examples must work with existing K8s deployment
- No modifications to existing NATS cluster configuration
- Examples must handle port-forwarding transparently
- Clear console output for learning/debugging
- Follow existing SDK patterns (DDD, hexagonal architecture)

K8s Environment Constraints (verified from cluster):
- Namespace: `aegis-trader`
- NATS service: `aegis-trader-nats` (ClusterIP)
- NATS port: `4222` (TCP)
- Existing pods: aegis-trader-nats-0, monitor-api, monitor-ui, nats-box
- Port forwarding already active on localhost:4222
- Support both in-cluster and port-forwarded access
- Handle kubectl context switching gracefully

### Testing Requirements
Testing approach [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- All examples must have accompanying tests
- Tests must work with port-forwarded NATS
- Use pytest with @pytest.mark.asyncio
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate against real K8s environment

Test scenarios to implement:
- test_auto_discovery_finds_nats_service
- test_examples_run_successfully
- test_failover_visible_in_output
- test_service_discovery_shows_all_services
- test_quickstart_under_five_minutes
- test_works_with_port_forwarding

### Integration with Existing Code
Current SDK usage pattern (complex):
```python
# Current complex setup
nats = NATSAdapter()
await nats.connect("nats://localhost:4222")
kv_store = NATSKVStore(nats)
await kv_store.connect("service_registry")
registry = KVServiceRegistry(kv_store)
discovery = BasicServiceDiscovery(registry)
service = Service("my-service", nats, registry, discovery, ...)
```

New simplified pattern (developer-friendly):
```python
# New simple setup
from aegis_sdk.developer import quick_setup

service = await quick_setup("my-service")
# Auto-discovers K8s NATS, configures everything

@service.rpc("echo")
async def echo(params):
    return {"echo": params}

await service.start()
```

### Key Implementation Considerations
- **Zero Configuration Goal**: Developers shouldn't need to know NATS URLs or K8s details
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple examples first, advanced patterns later
- **Observable Behavior**: All examples should have clear, visible output
- **Fail-Fast**: Clear error messages when K8s/NATS not available
- **Interactive Mode**: CLI tools should support interactive exploration
- **Documentation First**: Write docs alongside code for better learning
- **Two Fundamental Service Patterns**: Clearly distinguish between:
  1. Load-Balanced Service Pattern: Multiple active instances using base Service class
  2. Sticky Single-Active Pattern: SingleActiveService with client-side retry mechanism
- **External Tools Pattern**: Building tools that observe/manage the system (use infrastructure components directly, like monitor-api)
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Show how to add observability data to ServiceInstance.metadata
- **Monitor-API as Reference**: Use monitor-api as example of external client pattern

### Developer Experience Principles
- **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults for everything
- **Fast Feedback Loop**: See results immediately
- **Learning by Doing**: Interactive examples over static docs
- **Real Environment**: Test against actual K8s, not mocks
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Clear Pattern Demonstration**: Each example should clearly show:
  - Load-Balanced Pattern: Use base Service for stateless, horizontally scalable services
  - Sticky Single-Active Pattern: Use SingleActiveService + client retry for stateful, ordered processing
  - External Tools: Use infrastructure components directly for management/monitoring (not a service pattern)
