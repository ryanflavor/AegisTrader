# Story 1.2: Generic Gateway Service and CTP Adapter

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** System,
**I want** to implement a generic, high-availability gateway service using the SingleActiveService pattern and create the specific adapter for the CTP data source,
**so that** a robust foundation for connecting to multiple exchanges is established.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 创建一个 market-gateway 服务，该服务必须继承自 AegisSDK 的 SingleActiveService。
2. 服务内包含通用的连接管理逻辑（连接、断开、重连）。
3. 实现一个专门用于CTP的**适配器 (Adapter)**，负责处理CTP协议的认证和连接细节。
4. 服务能够通过CTP适配器成功连接到CTP数据源并维持心跳。

## Dev Notes

### DDD Context Integration
[Source: docs/market_service/architecture-overview.md]

**Gateway Context (支撑子域)**
- **Responsibility**: Connection management, authentication, reconnection mechanisms
- **Location**: `domain/gateway/` and `infra/gateway/`
- **Key Patterns**:
  - SingleActiveService for high availability
  - Adapter pattern for protocol abstraction
  - Anti-Corruption Layer for data translation

### Domain Events Flow
[Source: docs/market_service/01-domain-exploration.md]

**Gateway Lifecycle Events:**
1. `GatewayInitialized` → Service starts and registers
2. `LeadershipAcquired` → Becomes active instance
3. `ConnectionAttempted` → Tries to connect to exchange
4. `GatewayConnected` → Successfully authenticated
5. `HeartbeatReceived` → Maintains connection health
6. `GatewayDisconnected` → Connection lost
7. `LeadershipLost` → Another instance takes over

### Technical Architecture
[Source: docs/market_service/04-architecture-patterns.md]

**SingleActiveService Pattern:**
```yaml
Pattern: Leader-Follower with automatic failover
Election: NATS KV store with TTL-based leadership
Failover: < 2 seconds detection and recovery
State: Shared via NATS KV for seamless takeover
```

**Gateway Adapter Architecture:**
```
Domain Layer          Port            Infrastructure
┌─────────────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   Gateway   │───▶│Gateway │◀───│ CtpAdapter   │
│   Service   │    │  Port  │    │  (vnpy)      │
└─────────────┘    └────────┘    └──────────────┘
                                  ┌──────────────┐
                                  │ SoptAdapter  │
                                  │  (future)    │
                                  └──────────────┘
```

### Business Invariants
[Source: docs/market_service/03-tactical-design.md]

**Gateway Invariants to Enforce:**
1. **Single Active Connection**: Only one gateway instance can be connected to an exchange at a time
2. **Heartbeat Continuity**: Heartbeat interval must not exceed configured timeout (typically 60s)
3. **State Consistency**: Connection state must be synchronized across failover
4. **Authentication Security**: Credentials must never be logged or exposed

### CTP Integration Details
[Source: vnpy documentation]

**CTP Connection Requirements:**
- **Front Addresses**: Multiple trading front addresses for redundancy
- **Authentication**: UserID, Password, BrokerID, AppID, AuthCode
- **Heartbeat**: Automatic heartbeat every 30 seconds
- **Market Data**: Separate MD (Market Data) and TD (Trading) connections

**CTP-Specific Error Codes:**
- -1: Network connection failure
- -2: Login attempt before connection
- -3: Authentication failure
- 7: Insufficient trading permissions
- 8: Invalid password

### Testing Strategy
[Source: TDD Test Engineer Guidelines - test.md]

**Test Pyramid for Gateway Service:**
```
         /\
        /E2E\        5% - Full CTP connection tests
       /------\
      /  Integ \     15% - Service interaction tests
     /----------\
    /    Unit    \   80% - Domain logic and adapters
   /--------------\
```

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
1. **Failover Testing**: Measure actual failover time
2. **Network Resilience**: Simulate packet loss, latency
3. **Authentication Edge Cases**: Wrong credentials, expired tokens
4. **State Recovery**: Verify state after unexpected restart

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/market_service/README.md]

**Gateway Performance Targets:**
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Failover Time | < 2 seconds | P99 |
| Connection Success | > 99.9% | Daily average |
| Heartbeat Latency | < 100ms | P95 |
| Memory Usage | < 500MB | Peak during operation |

### Configuration Schema
```yaml
# Environment variables for CTP Gateway
CTP_USER_ID: "your_user_id"
CTP_PASSWORD: "your_password"
CTP_BROKER_ID: "9999"  # SimNow default
CTP_TD_ADDRESS: "tcp://180.168.146.187:10130"  # SimNow TD
CTP_MD_ADDRESS: "tcp://180.168.146.187:10131"  # SimNow MD
CTP_APP_ID: "simnow_client_test"
CTP_AUTH_CODE: "0000000000000000"

# Gateway service configuration
GATEWAY_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 30  # seconds
GATEWAY_RECONNECT_DELAY: 5      # seconds
GATEWAY_MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS: 10
GATEWAY_FAILOVER_TIMEOUT: 2     # seconds
```

  - Integrated state persistence into ConnectionManager with automatic saving on state changes
  - Added comprehensive metrics collection with GatewayMetrics and MetricsCollector classes
  - Metrics include: connection attempts/successes/failures, heartbeat latency, failover duration
  - Added error categorization (auth, network, timeout, circuit_breaker)
  - Implemented metric buffers with limits to prevent memory growth
  - All 34 new tests passing (13 for state persistence, 21 for metrics)
- 2025-08-13 Testing Strategy Refinement:
  - Implemented proper MockElectionRepository following SDK trust principle
  - Fixed all mock election integration tests (10/10 passing)
  - Gateway service correctly inherits from SDK's SingleActiveService
  - Tests focus on business logic, not SDK internals (as per architecture guidance)
  - Circuit breaker tests updated to use actual implementation methods
  - Metrics tests properly handle GatewayMetrics object structure
  - Achieved comprehensive test coverage with SDK-aware mocking strategy
- 2025-08-13 Task 12 Completion:
  - Enhanced MetricsCollector with SDK metrics integration for proper Gauge/Histogram/Counter metrics
  - Implemented GatewayStructuredLogger for JSON-formatted structured logging of all connection events
  - Created comprehensive dashboard configuration with 6 sections and 7 alert rules
  - Dashboard includes: connection status, heartbeat monitoring, failover metrics, error analysis
  - Added Grafana export functionality for dashboard configuration
  - Implemented 30 new tests for metrics and logging functionality
  - All tests passing (30/30) for enhanced monitoring features
