# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the existing **AegisSDK** to support a distributed trading system. This involves delivering a framework with a persistent **service registry**, a **"sticky single-active" RPC pattern** for high availability, and a web-based **monitoring and management UI**.

## **Background Context**
The `AegisSDK` is a lightweight, high-performance IPC framework. To be applied to production-grade trading systems—which have stringent requirements for reliability and observability—it must be augmented with centralized service management, real-time monitoring, and a high-availability communication pattern suitable for specific trading scenarios.
