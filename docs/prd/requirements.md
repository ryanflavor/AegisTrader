# **Requirements**

## **Functional**
* **FR1**: The system must provide a web-based monitoring and management interface.
* **FR2**: The interface must display real-time performance metrics for each service instance, including RPC latencies, success/error rates, and queue depths.
* **FR3**: The system must provide a highly available service registry using the **NATS KV Store** for persistence.
* **FR4**: A management service, built with **FastAPI**, must expose a secure HTTP API for full CRUD (Create, Read,
    Update, Delete) management of service definitions.
* **FR5**: The SDK must support externalized configuration for parameters like connection pool size and RPC
    timeouts.
* **FR6**: The management API must provide an endpoint to view the current configuration of any service instance.
* **FR7**: The SDK must implement a "Sticky Single-Active" RPC pattern with synchronous responses and automatic
    failover.

## **Non Functional**
* **NFR1**: Performance baselines must be established for the existing SDK before new development begins.
* **NFR2**: New features must not degrade the baseline p99 RPC latency by more than 10%.
* **NFR3**: The failover process for the "Sticky Single-Active" pattern must complete within 2 seconds.
* **NFR4**: All enhancements must be backward compatible.
* **NFR5**: The management interface and its API must be secured against unauthorized access.
* **NFR6**: No single point of failure shall exist in the system's core components.
* **NFR7**: All critical persistent data must be replicated across multiple nodes.
* **NFR8**: The `AegisSDK` client must handle NATS node failures with transparent, automatic failover.
