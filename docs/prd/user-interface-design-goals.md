# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**
To create a clean, professional, and information-dense monitoring and management interface that prioritizes data clarity and operational efficiency for technical and operations personnel.

## **Core Screens and Views**
* **Dashboard**: A global overview displaying all registered service instances and their health status.
* **Service Detail View**: A page for deep-dive analysis of a single instance's real-time and historical performance metrics.
* **Configuration View**: A section to display the current configuration of a selected service.
* **Service Management**: A full CRUD interface for managing service definitions within the registry.

## **Accessibility**
The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards where feasible.

## **Branding**
The interface will use a clean, professional theme suitable for a technical tool. No complex branding is required for the initial version.

## **Target Device and Platforms**
The primary target is a responsive web interface for desktop browsers.
