# ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a clean architecture that separates business logic from infrastructure concerns while enabling testability and maintainability. The service must integrate with external systems (NATS, Monitor API) without coupling the domain to these dependencies.

## Decision
We will implement Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) pattern with clear layer separation:
- Domain layer contains pure business logic
- Application layer orchestrates use cases
- Infrastructure layer implements external integrations
- Ports define interfaces between layers
- Adapters implement port interfaces

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain logic is testable in isolation
- Easy to swap infrastructure implementations
- Follows DDD principles naturally
- Reduces coupling between layers

### Negative
- More initial boilerplate code
- Additional abstraction layers
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the pattern

## Implementation
- Port interfaces defined in `type_definitions/interfaces.py`
- Adapters implemented in `infra/adapters.py`
- Factory pattern for dependency injection in `infra/factory.py`
