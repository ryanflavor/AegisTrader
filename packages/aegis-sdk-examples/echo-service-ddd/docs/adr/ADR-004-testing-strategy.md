# ADR-004: Test-Driven Development Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures code quality, enables refactoring confidence, and documents expected behavior. The testing approach must align with our architectural patterns.

## Decision
We will follow strict TDD principles with:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions with real dependencies
- **Test Pyramid**: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests
- **Test Naming**: `test_{functionality}_{expected_behavior}`
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% overall, 100% for critical paths
- **Framework**: Pytest exclusively
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for test setup
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Consequences

### Positive
- High confidence in code correctness
- Tests serve as documentation
- Enables fearless refactoring
- Catches bugs early
- Forces good design (testable code)

### Negative
- Initial development slower
- Test maintenance overhead
- Risk of over-mocking
- False confidence from high coverage

## Implementation
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`
- Run with `pytest` command
- Coverage with `pytest --cov`
