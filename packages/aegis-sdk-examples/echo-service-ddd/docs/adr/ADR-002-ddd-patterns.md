# ADR-002: Domain-Driven Design Patterns

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The service needs to model complex business logic for echo processing while maintaining clear boundaries and encapsulation. We need patterns that express business concepts clearly and maintain consistency.

## Decision
We will implement core DDD tactical patterns:
- **Entities**: Objects with identity (EchoRequest, EchoResponse)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity (EchoMode, MessagePriority)
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities (EchoProcessor, MetricsCollector)
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access
- **Domain Events**: Capture significant business occurrences
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries (future implementation)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Business logic is explicit and discoverable
- Ubiquitous language throughout codebase
- Clear consistency boundaries
- Domain events enable loose coupling
- Repository pattern enables persistence flexibility

### Negative
- More classes and abstractions
- Requires team understanding of DDD concepts
- Can lead to over-engineering for simple domains

## Implementation
- Entities in `domain/entities.py`
- Value objects in `domain/value_objects.py`
- Domain services in `domain/services.py`
- Repository interfaces in `domain/repositories.py`
- Domain events in `domain/events.py`
