# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Echo Service DDD example.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |
|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-hexagonal-architecture.md) | Hexagonal Architecture | Accepted | Implement Ports and Adapters pattern for clean separation |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-ddd-patterns.md) | Domain-Driven Design Patterns | Accepted | Use DDD tactical patterns for domain modeling |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-cqrs-pattern.md) | CQRS Pattern | Accepted | Separate command and query responsibilities |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-testing-strategy.md) | Test-Driven Development Strategy | Accepted | Follow strict TDD with pytest framework |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-dependency-injection.md) | Dependency Injection with Factory | Accepted | Use factory pattern for dependency management |

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context
[Describe the issue motivating this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the decision and rationale]

## Consequences

### Positive
[List positive outcomes]

### Negative
[List negative outcomes or trade-offs]

## Implementation
[Brief notes on how to implement]
```

## Guidelines

1. Number ADRs sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
2. Keep ADRs concise but complete
3. Focus on "why" not just "what"
4. Include enough context for future understanding
5. Update status when decisions change
6. Link to superseding ADRs when deprecated
