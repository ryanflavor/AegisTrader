### Ports Layer (100% Coverage)
- All port interfaces have 100% coverage

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Service Class Tests
- Fixed `_is_service_name` logic to properly detect instance IDs
- Added lifecycle state support for stopping unstarted services
- Added console output for heartbeat errors when logger is not available
- Fixed async/await issues in tests
- Added proper mocking for `is_operational` checks

### 2. Test Improvements
- Updated tests to expect multiple error logs where appropriate
- Fixed race conditions in async tests
- Improved test isolation and mocking strategies

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Applied TDD principles throughout refactoring
- Maintained hexagonal architecture boundaries
- Enhanced type safety with proper Pydantic models
- Improved error handling and logging

## Remaining Work

While we've achieved the 90% coverage target, there are still 21 failing tests that could be fixed:
1. SingleActiveService tests (6) - Need to update for new architecture
2. NATSKVStore tests (12) - Configuration and connection handling
3. Other misc tests (3)

## Recommendations

1. **Priority**: Fix the remaining failing tests to ensure a stable test suite
2. **Future Work**: Increase coverage of `nats_kv_election_repository.py` (currently 22%)
3. **Maintenance**: Keep test coverage above 90% for all new code

## Git Commit Message
```
test(aegis-sdk): increase test coverage to 90% and fix failing tests

- Fixed 8 failing Service class tests by updating lifecycle management and error handling
